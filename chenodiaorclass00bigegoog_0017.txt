CHENODIA.

REX ARTHURUS.

Wnnrt King Arthur ruled the land,
He ruled it like a king:

He bought four pecks of barley-meal
To make a brave pudding.

A pudding brave the king did make
And stuffed it well with plums ;

Great lumps of suet he put into it,
As big as both his thumbS.

The king and queen partook thereos,

And all the court beside ;
And what they did not eat'that night,

The queen next morning fried.

Anorrn rex imperio potitus,

Hordei nactus modium farinae,

Ordinat coeni propere instituti
Sternere mensam.
