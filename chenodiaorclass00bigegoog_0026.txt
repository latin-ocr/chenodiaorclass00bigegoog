CHENODIA·

BOPIPIAS.

LmLE Bo Peep has lost her sheep, Ι
And could n't tell where to find 'em.
Let ’em alone, and they 'll come home,

And bring their tails behind 'em.

Parvula Bopipias amissos quaeritat agnos,
Nec reperire locum quo latuere potest.

Desine, Bopipias‚ redeuntes nocte videbis,

Caudasque incolumes post sua crura ferent.

ADVENAE MENDICI.

Hm, hark‚ the dogs do bark,
The beggars have come to town 3
Some in rags and some in jags,
And some in velvet gowns.
