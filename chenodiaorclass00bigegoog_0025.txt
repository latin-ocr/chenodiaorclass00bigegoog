CHENODIA.

The little man thus spoke;

His heart was almost broke;
- *And all for the sake of her charms charms charms.
So the little maid relented‚
And sostened she consented
The little man to take to her arms arms arms.

Sic satur ille lacrymans ex corde desolato,

Et propter pulchritudinem ad mortem vulnerato.
Mollitur tum puellula, amorem et agnovit,
Beatumque homunculum amplexu suo fovit.
