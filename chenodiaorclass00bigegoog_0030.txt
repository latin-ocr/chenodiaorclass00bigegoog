FELIS IN FIDIBUS.

Hmcn diddle diddle,

The cat and the fiddle,

The cow jumped over the moon.
The little dog laughed
To see such a craft,

And the dish ran away with the spoon.

Hidideldelis,
In fidibus felis,
Super lunam vacca saltavit.
Tum risit canicula,
Visa re tam ridicula,
Et lanx cochleare raptavit
