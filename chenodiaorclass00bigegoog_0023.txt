CHENODIA.

HOMUNCULUS ET PUELLULA

’ Turius was a little man, Χ
And he wooed a little maid,

And he said, Little maid, will you wed wed wed?
I have little more to say,
Then will'you ay or nay,

For the least said is soonest mended ded ded.

Homunculus eximius puellulam amavit,

Quam ut subendam duceret sic ore compellavit:
Quid verbis opus pluribus? Dic volo, dieve nolo,
Sat verbum sapientibus: responde sine dolo.

Then the little maid replied‚
“ Should 1 be your little bride,

'Pray, what shall we have for to eat eat eat?

Will the flame that you are rich in

Make a fire in the kitchen,

Or the little god of love turn the spit spit spit ?'’
