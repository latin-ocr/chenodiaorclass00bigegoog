- CHENODIA.

- JACKUS ET JILLA

μοι( and Jill
Went up the hill,
To draw a pail of water;
Jack fellwdown
And broke his crown,

And Jill came tumbling aster.

Jackus cum Jilla
Formosa ancillfl,

Aquam hauriturus collem ascendebat 3 Ι
Prolabitur Jackus,

Caput miser& fractus,
Et Jilla desperata in fatum ruebat
