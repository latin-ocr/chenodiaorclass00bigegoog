CHENODIA.

VETULA CALCEOCOLA.

Tuauu was an old woman who lived io a shoe‚

Who had so many children she did n’t know what
to d0;

She gave them some brcth without any bread,

And whipt them all soundly and sent them to bed.

Calceus inclusit vetulam turbamque suorum,

Multum quae luctans natos compescuit arctos;

{⁵ Jus illis profert oblita apponere panem, ⁴
Verberibusque datis dormitum saeva remittit.
